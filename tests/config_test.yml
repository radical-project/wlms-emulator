# Assumptions:
# Each task has a number of operations to perform
# Each core has a number of operations it can perform per second

# - task_selector = task selection criterion. Current criteria are:
#    . 'all' = select all the tasks for execution
#    . int = select all the tasks that have more than int operations
# - resource_selector = resource selection criterion. E.g., select only
#    . 'all' = select all given resources
#    . int = select all the resources that perform more than int operations
#      per second
# - binder: binding criterion. Current criteria are:
#    . 'tte' = bind the task with the largest number of operations to the
#      resource that can perform the highest number of operations per second
#    . 'rr' = bind tasks to resources in the order in which they are received.
